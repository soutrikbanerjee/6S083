- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @soutrikbanerjee
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested coding with `Stata, Sas, R, Python, Matlab, Mathematica, SQL, MLwiN, BUGS, ...`
- ðŸ‘€ The open-source IDE's I prefer `VSCode, RStudio (Posit), Jupyter, ...`
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning `Julia`, which is both an OOP & functional, line-interpreted & compiled language that has similarities in syntaxes with `R, Python, Scala, Matlab` among others. It is supposed to be very fast (`C`), with the ease of `Python`, & has the scientific prowess of `R`.
- ðŸ‘€ The GUI-based Statistical package that I love the most is `Statistica`.
